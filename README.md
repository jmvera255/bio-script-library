# bio-script-library
Personal library of Perl scripts developed and used during graduate school and postdoctoral research. 
Includes basic bioinformatics-driven tools for working with BED and FASTA files.

`python/` contains python3 versions of Perl scripts in `perl/` that I have been writing as 
a way to gain more experience with Python.
